          <strong>Vocal Clues</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <stan>
            Cats can be very vocal, especially when they’re happy. Vocal kitties
            may have long conversations with you, and the pitch of their meow
            will allude to how they are feeling.
            <br />
            A high-pitched meow is a content cat, while a low-pitched meow may
            indicate an unhappy or annoyed kitty. That ""prrrrupttt!"" sound
            many cats make, is also a good indication of a happy cat.
            <br />
            While purring is not always a sure-fire sign of a cheerful cat, for
            the most part, it can be an indication of feline contentment or even
            bliss.

          <strong>Social Sleeping</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <stan>
            While cats may sleep more when depressed, their sleep locations can
            be an indication of happiness. If your kitty sleeps with other cats
            or chooses you as a bed-buddy – this indicates happy relationships.

          <strong>Playful Behaviour</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <stan>
            Play is a great indication of happiness, and your kitty will play
            with other pets and humans that they like or trust.
            <br />
            From exuberant sprints and kitty wrestling matches to calm paw
            patting of the features, these playful activities indicate a happy
            cat.
